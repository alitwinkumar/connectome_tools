# connectome_tools
This repository contains tools for analyzing synaptic connectivity data.

The file connectome_loaders.py contains functions that return synaptic connectivity for the [Janelia hemibrain (Scheffer et al. 2020)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/57443), [larval connectome (Winding et al. 2023)](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.add9330), and [FlyWire (Dorkenwald et al. 2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01330-0) datasets. Function docstrings contain instructions for how to download the data.

The file plot_conn_flywire.py shows example code for visualizing and calculating connectivity statistics for the FlyWire connectome, including analyses grouped by neurotransmitter type.
